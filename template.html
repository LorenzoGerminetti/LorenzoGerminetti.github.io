		<h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
		<h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
		<h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
		<h5>Heading Level 5</h5>	
		<p> <strong>Bold text</strong>: there are two ways to get bold text in a paragraph.
			The first is with the "<"b">" <b>element</b>. The second is with
			the "<"strong">" <strong>element</strong>. The strong element 
			is semantically used to give strong importance to text, and is 
			thus the most popular option for bolding text. The b element,
			on the other hand, semantically means to stylistically offset 
			text, which isnâ€™t always the best choice for text deserving 
			prominent attention. We have to gauge the significance of the
			text we wish to set as bold and to choose an element accordingly.</p>
